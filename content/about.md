Hello, I'm Ege Güneş.

I'm a software developer. Also ~~in parallel I'm studying law~~ I've finished Law school.

I like all things open source and decentralized.

Here is my [GitHub](https://github.com/egegunes) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/egegunes/).

You can always reach me by [email](mailto:egegunes@gmail.com).
