There is a new meetup in town that I'm very excited about: [Cloud Native
Istanbul](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-Istanbul/)

The meetup is started by [Kaan Demircan](https://twitter.com/kaandemircan) and
[Engin Ã–zkurt](https://twitter.com/ozkurtengin). Kaan and Engin are both work
for Microsoft and their main focus is on providing open source solutions to
Microsoft's clients.

I attended the first and so far only meeting of the group. It was a small
meeting (11 people) in Akasya Shopping Mall.

Naturally, it was an introductory meeting. We met with each other and chatted
generally about new and old technologies, running systems in scale and the
roadmap of the meetup.

The conversation continued for 3 hours and we could stay except for time got
late. I really enjoyed it! I hope it persists and we can create a cloud native
community.
